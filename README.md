# Artificial-Intelligence
Advanced Boston University Artificial intelligence Class Labs Projects

During this class with my team, we built projects to solve some AI problems. 
 
### A Game AI using Minimax Alpha Beta Pruning to solve a game in the most optimal way.

### We built a Hand gesture detection algorithm using state of the art computer vision techniques with OpenCV Python.

### We built a Neural Network completely from scratch using Python and Numpy.
