# Artificial-Intelligence
Advanced Boston University Artificial intelligence Class Labs Projects

During this class with my team, we built projects to solve some AI problems. 
 
## A game AI using Minimax Alpha beta pruning to solve a game in the most optimal way.

## We built a hand gesture detection algorithm using state of the art computer vision techniques with OpenCV Python.

## We built a neural network completely from scratch using Python and Numpy.
